\usage{
estHgtRisk(.col_sel, .coefs, .age, .datadir, .simsdir, .outdir)
}
\arguments{
\item{.col_sel}{A data frame with the coordinates and id of the colony we want to
simulate around c("lon", "lat", "id").}

\item{.coefs}{A list with samples of random coefficients. Each element in the
list corresponds to a set of coefficients for a different individual.}

\item{.datadir}{A character string with the path to the directory containing
the auxiliary data needed for the estimation (i.e. colony and supplementary
feeding sites data).}

\item{.simsdir}{A character string with the path to the directory containing
the points for which height risk wants to be estimated.}

\item{.outdir}{A character string with the path to the directory where the
results are to be stored at in disk. If NULL the results are not stored.}
